# Hello Example

## Summary

This example demonstrates a dead simple dapp consisting of two canister smart contracts:

* a simple backend canister, `hello`, implementing the logic of the application in Rust, and
* a simple frontend asset canister, `hello_assets` serving the assets of the dapp's web user interface.

This example is based on the default project created by running
`dfx new --type=rust hello` as described more fully
[here](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/rust-guide/rust-quickstart.html).

### Motoko variant

A version of this example with a Motoko implementation of canister `hello` can be found [here](../../motoko/hello/README.md).

## Security Considerations and Security Best Practices

If you base your application on this example, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [Security Best Practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. This example may not implement all the best practices.

## Interface

Canister `hello` is defined as a Rust library:

* [src/hello/lib.rs](src/hello/lib.rs)

with the Candid interface:

```
service : {
  greet: (text) -> (text);
}
```

The frontend displays a page with an HTML text box for the argument and a button for calling the function greet with that argument. The result of the call is displayed in a message box.

The relevant frontend code is:

* [src/hello_assets/src/index.html](src/hello_assets/src/index.html)
* [src/hello_assets/src/index.jsx](src/hello_assets/src/index.jsx)


## Requirements

The example requires an installation of:

* [DFINITY Canister SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org).
* `node.js` (to build the web frontend).
* a suitable installaton of `rust` and `cmake` (see [here](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/rust-guide/rust-quickstart.html#before-you-begin)).

## Setup

Check, you have stopped any local canister execution environment (i.e. `replica`) or other network process that would create a port conflict on 8000.

## Running Locally

Using two terminal windows, do the following steps:

1. Open the first terminal window.

1. Start a local canister execution environment

   ```text
   dfx start
   ```

   This command produces a lot of distracting diagnostic output which is best ignored by continuing in a second terminal.

1. Open the second terminal window.

1. Ensure that the required `node` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:

   ```text
   npm install
   ```

1. Register, build and deploy the project.

   ```text
   dfx deploy
   ```

1. Call the hello canister's greet function:

   ```text
   dfx canister call hello greet '("everyone")'
   ```

1. Observe the following result.

   ```text
   ("Hello, everyone!")
   ```

The previous steps use `dfx` to directly call the function on the `hello` (backend) canister.

To access the web user interface of the dapp, that is served by canister `hello_assets`, do the following:

1. Determine the URL of the `hello_assets` asset canister.

   ```text
   echo "http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=$(dfx canister id hello_assets)"
   ```

1. Navigate to the URL in your browser.

2. The browser should display a simple HTML page with a sample asset image file, an input field, and a button.

3. Enter the text `everyone` and click the button to see the greeting returned by the backend `hello` canister.

## Troubleshooting

If the web page doesn't display properly, or displays the wrong contents,
you may need to clear your browser cache.

Alternatively, open the URL in a fresh, in-private browser window to start with a clean cache.
