# Purpose

The purpose of this dapp is to give developers a minimal dapp that uses the IC's HTTPS outcalls feature to make a GET request.

This demo goes in hand with the [developer documentation on HTTPS Outcalls]
(https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-get).
