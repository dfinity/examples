# Token transfer_from

[View this samples code on GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer_from).

## Overview

`token_transfer_from_backend` is a canister that can transfer ICRC-1 tokens on behalf of accounts to other accounts. It is an example of a canister that uses an ICRC-1 ledger canister that supports the [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-2) approve and transfer from standard. Sample code is available in [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer_from) and [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer_from).

## Architecture

The sample code revolves around one core transfer function which takes as input the amount of tokens to transfer, the `Account` to which to transfer tokens and returns either success or an error in case e.g. the token transfer canister doesnâ€™t have enough tokens to do the transfer or the caller has not approved the canister to spend their tokens. In case of success, a unique identifier of the transaction is returned. The example code assumes the caller of `transfer` has already approved the token transfer canister to spend their tokens.

This sample will use the Rust variant.

## Prerequisites

This example requires an installation of:

-   [x] Install the [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx).
-   [x] Download and install [git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## How to get there

The following steps will guide you through the process of setting up the token transfer canister for your own project.

> [!TIP]
> If you just want to interact with this example, follow steps 4-6 and 8-10 below.

### Step 1: Create a new `dfx` project and navigate into the project's directory.

```bash
dfx new --type=rust token_transfer_from --no-frontend
cd token_transfer_from
```

### Step 2: Determine ICRC-1 ledger file locations

> [!NOTE]
> You can read more about how to setup the ICRC-1 ledger locally [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/icrc-1/icrc1-ledger-setup).

Go to the [releases overview](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/releases) and copy the latest replica binary revision. At the time of writing, this is `d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929`.

The URL for the ledger Wasm module is `https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/<REVISION>/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz`, so with the above revision it would be `https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz`.

The URL for the ledger .did file is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/<REVISION>/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did`, so with the above revision it would be `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did`.

**OPTIONAL:**
If you want to make sure, you have the latest ICRC-1 ledger files you can run the following script.

```sh
curl -o download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/326df23607fc8280a047daba2d8462f1dfc57466/rs/rosetta-api/scripts/download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh"
chmod +x download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh
./download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh
```

### Step 3: Configure the `dfx.json` file to use the ledger :

Replace its contents with this but adapt the URLs to be the ones you determined in step 2. Note that we are deploying the ICRC-1 ledger to the same canister id the ckBTC ledger uses on mainnet. This will make it easier to interact with it later.

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "token_transfer_from_backend": {
            "candid": "src/token_transfer_from_backend/token_transfer_from_backend.did",
            "package": "token_transfer_from_backend",
            "type": "rust"
        },
        "icrc1_ledger_canister": {
            "type": "custom",
            "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did",
            "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz",
            "specified_id": "mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai"
        }
    },
    "defaults": {
        "build": {
            "args": "",
            "packtool": ""
        }
    },
    "output_env_file": ".env",
    "version": 1
}
```

If you chose to download the ICRC-1 ledger files with the script, you need to replace the Candid and Wasm file entries:

```
...
"candid": icrc1_ledger.did,
"wasm" : icrc1_ledger.wasm.gz,
...
```

### Step 4: Start a local replica:

```bash
dfx start --background --clean
```

### Step 5: Deploy the ICRC-1 ledger locally:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Transfers from the `minting_account` will create Mint transactions. Transfers to the minting account will create Burn transactions.

Take a moment to read the details of the call made below. Not only are you deploying an ICRC-1 ledger canister, you are also:

-   Setting the minting account to the anonymous principal (`2vxsx-fae`)
-   Minting 100 tokens to the default identity
-   Setting the transfer fee to 0.0001 tokens
-   Naming the token Local ICRC1 / L-ICRC1
-   Enabling the ICRC-2 standard for the ledger

```bash
dfx deploy icrc1_ledger_canister --argument "(variant {
  Init = record {
    token_symbol = \"ICRC1\";
    token_name = \"L-ICRC1\";
    minting_account = record {
      owner = principal \"$(dfx identity --identity anonymous get-principal)\"
    };
    transfer_fee = 10_000;
    metadata = vec {};
    initial_balances = vec {
      record {
        record {
          owner = principal \"$(dfx identity --identity default get-principal)\";
        };
        10_000_000_000;
      };
    };
    archive_options = record {
      num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
      trigger_threshold = 2000;
      controller_id = principal \"$(dfx identity --identity anonymous get-principal)\";
    };
    feature_flags = opt record {
      icrc2 = true;
    };
  }
})"
```

If successful, the output should be:

```bash
Deployed canisters.
URLs:
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    icrc1_ledger_canister: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai&id=mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai
```

### Step 6: Verify that the ledger canister is healthy and working as expected by using the command:

> [!NOTE]
> You can find more information on how to interact with the ICRC-1 ledger [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/icrc-1/using-icrc1-ledger#icrc-1-and-icrc-1-extension-endpoints)

````bash
dfx canister call icrc1_ledger_canister icrc1_balance_of "(record {
  owner = principal \"$(dfx identity --identity default get-principal)\";
})"
```

The output should be:

```bash
(10_000_000_000 : nat)
````

### Step 7: Prepare the token transfer canister:

Replace the contents of the `src/token_transfer_from_backend/Cargo.toml` file with the following:

```toml
[package]
name = "token_transfer_from_backend"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
candid = "0.10"
ic-cdk = "0.12"
ic-cdk-timers = "0.6" # Feel free to remove this dependency if you don't need timers
icrc-ledger-types = "0.1.5"
serde = "1.0.197"
```

Replace the contents of the `src/token_transfer_from_backend/src/lib.rs` file with the following:

```rust
use candid::{CandidType, Deserialize, Principal};
use icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::account::Account;
use icrc_ledger_types::icrc1::transfer::{BlockIndex, NumTokens};
use icrc_ledger_types::icrc2::transfer_from::{TransferFromArgs, TransferFromError};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(CandidType, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct TransferArgs {
    amount: NumTokens,
    to_account: Account,
}

#[ic_cdk::update]
async fn transfer(args: TransferArgs) -> Result<BlockIndex, String> {
    ic_cdk::println!(
        "Transferring {} tokens to account {}",
        &args.amount,
        &args.to_account,
    );

    let transfer_from_args = TransferFromArgs {
        // the account we want to transfer tokens from (in this case we assume the caller approved the canister to spend funds on their behalf)
        from: Account::from(ic_cdk::caller()),
        // can be used to distinguish between transactions
        memo: None,
        // the amount we want to transfer
        amount: args.amount,
        // the subaccount we want to spend the tokens from (in this case we assume the default subaccount has been approved)
        spender_subaccount: None,
        // if not specified, the default fee for the canister is used
        fee: None,
        // the account we want to transfer tokens to
        to: args.to_account,
        // a timestamp indicating when the transaction was created by the caller; if it is not specified by the caller then this is set to the current ICP time
        created_at_time: None,
    };

    // 1. Asynchronously call another canister function using `ic_cdk::call`.
    ic_cdk::call::<(TransferFromArgs,), (Result<BlockIndex, TransferFromError>,)>(
        // 2. Convert a textual representation of a Principal into an actual `Principal` object. The principal is the one we specified in `dfx.json`.
        //    `expect` will panic if the conversion fails, ensuring the code does not proceed with an invalid principal.
        Principal::from_text("mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai")
            .expect("Could not decode the principal."),
        // 3. Specify the method name on the target canister to be called, in this case, "icrc1_transfer".
        "icrc2_transfer_from",
        // 4. Provide the arguments for the call in a tuple, here `transfer_args` is encapsulated as a single-element tuple.
        (transfer_from_args,),
    )
    .await // 5. Await the completion of the asynchronous call, pausing the execution until the future is resolved.
    // 6. Apply `map_err` to transform any network or system errors encountered during the call into a more readable string format.
    //    The `?` operator is then used to propagate errors: if the result is an `Err`, it returns from the function with that error,
    //    otherwise, it unwraps the `Ok` value, allowing the chain to continue.
    .map_err(|e| format!("failed to call ledger: {:?}", e))?
    // 7. Access the first element of the tuple, which is the `Result<BlockIndex, TransferError>`, for further processing.
    .0
    // 8. Use `map_err` again to transform any specific ledger transfer errors into a readable string format, facilitating error handling and debugging.
    .map_err(|e| format!("ledger transfer error {:?}", e))
}

// Enable Candid export (see https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/generating-candid)
ic_cdk::export_candid!();

```

Replace the contents of the `src/token_transfer_from_backend/token_transfer_from_backend.did` file with the following:

> [!NOTE]
> The `token_transfer_from.did` file is a Candid file that describes the service interface of the canister. It was generated from the Rust code using the `candid-extractor` tool. You can read more about the necessary steps [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/generating-candid).

```did
type Account = record { owner : principal; subaccount : opt blob };
type Result = variant { Ok : nat; Err : text };
type TransferArgs = record { to_account : Account; amount : nat };
service : { transfer : (TransferArgs) -> (Result) }
```

### Step 8: Deploy the token transfer canister:

```bash
dfx deploy token_transfer_from_backend
```

### Step 9: Approve the canister to transfer funds on behalf of the user:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you are using the default `dfx` account that we minted tokens to in step 5 for the following steps.

Make the following call to approve the `token_transfer_from_backend` canister to transfer 100 tokens on behalf of the `default` identity:

```bash
dfx canister call --identity default icrc1_ledger_canister icrc2_approve "(
  record {
    spender= record {
      owner = principal \"$(dfx canister id token_transfer_from_backend)\";
    };
    amount = 10_000_000_000: nat;
  }
)"
```

If successful, the output should be:

```bash
(variant { Ok = 1 : nat })
```

### Step 10: Let the canister transfer funds on behalf of the user:

Now that the canister has an approval for the `default` identities tokens on the ledger, the canister can transfer 1 token on behalf of the `default` identity to another account, in this case to the canisters own account.

```bash
dfx canister call token_transfer_from_backend transfer "(record {
  amount = 100_000_000;
  to_account = record {
    owner = principal \"$(dfx canister id token_transfer_from_backend)\";
  };
})"
```

## Security considerations and best practices

If you base your application on this example, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [security best practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. This example may not implement all the best practices.

For example, the following aspects are particularly relevant for this app:

-   [Inter-canister calls and rollbacks](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/rust-canister-development-security-best-practices/#inter-canister-calls-and-rollbacks), since issues around inter-canister calls (here the ledger) can e.g. lead to time-of-check time-of-use or double spending security bugs.
-   [Certify query responses if they are relevant for security](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/general-security-best-practices#certify-query-responses-if-they-are-relevant-for-security), since this is essential when e.g. displaying important financial data in the frontend that may be used by users to decide on future transactions.
-   [Use a decentralized governance system like SNS to make a canister have a decentralized controller](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/rust-canister-development-security-best-practices#use-a-decentralized-governance-system-like-sns-to-make-a-canister-have-a-decentralized-controller), since decentralizing control is a fundamental aspect of decentralized finance applications.
