# Rust backend (Wasm64)

This backend-only project demonstrates how to write a simple smart contract for ICP using **Wasm64** compilation target.

This example specifically showcases building and deploying canisters compiled to the Wasm64 target, which provides access to 64-bit memory addressing and can handle larger memory spaces compared to the traditional Wasm32 target.

## What is Wasm64?

The Wasm64 target allows canisters to:

- Access larger memory spaces (up to 6GiB, compared to the 4GiB limit of Wasm32)
- Use 64-bit memory addressing

This example uses the `build.sh` script to build for Wasm64 using Rust's nightly toolchain and the `-Z build-std` feature.
