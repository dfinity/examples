# HTTP: GET

The purpose of this dapp is to give developers a minimal dapp that uses the IC's HTTPS outcalls feature to make a `GET` request.

This demo goes in hand with the [developer documentation on HTTPS outcalls](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-get).

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/examples
cd examples/rust/send_http_get
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
```
