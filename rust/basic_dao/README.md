# Basic decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

This sample project demonstrates a basic [decentralized autonomous organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) (DAO) that can be deployed to the [Internet Computer](https://github.com/dfinity/ic). The basic DAO sample code is available in [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/basic_dao) and [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/basic_dao). You can see a quick introduction on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/3IcYlieA-EE).

## Overview

A `basic_dao` can be initialized with a set of accounts: mappings from principal IDs to an amount of tokens. Account owners can query their account balance by calling `account_balance` and transfer tokens to other accounts by calling `transfer`. Anyone can call `list_accounts` to view all accounts.

Account owners can submit proposals by calling `submit_proposal`. A proposal specifies a canister, method and arguments for this method. Account owners can cast votes (either `Yes` or `No`) on a proposal by calling `vote`. The amount of votes cast is equal to amount of tokens the account owner has. If enough `Yes` votes are cast, `basic_dao` will execute the proposal by calling the proposalâ€™s given method with the given args against the given canister. If enough `No` votes are cast, the proposal is not executed, and is instead marked as `Rejected`.

Certain system parameters, like the number of `Yes` votes needed to pass a proposal, can be queried by calling `get_system_params`. These system params can be modified via the proposal process, i.e. a proposal can be made to call `update_system_params` with updated values. The below demo does exactly that.

## Security considerations and security best practices

If you base your application on this example, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [security best practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. This example may not implement all the best practices.

For example, the following aspects are particularly relevant for this app:
* [Use a decentralized governance system like SNS to make a canister have a decentralized controller](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/rust-canister-development-security-best-practices#use-a-decentralized-governance-system-like-sns-to-make-a-canister-have-a-decentralized-controller), since this is a DAO's use case.
* [Certify query responses if they are relevant for security](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/general-security-best-practices#certify-query-responses-if-they-are-relevant-for-security), since e.g. account_balance and list_accounts are query calls that a client may want to issue as update call.

### Prerequisites
This example requires an installation of:

- [x] The Rust toolchain (e.g. cargo).
- [x] [didc.](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/tree/master/tools/didc)
- [x] Install the [IC SDK](../developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx).


Begin by opening a terminal window.

* #### Step 1: Build the `basic_dao` canister:

```
make clean; make
```

 ### Step 2: Navigate into the folder containing the project's files and start a local instance of the Internet Computer with the command:

```
cd basic_dao
dfx start --background
```

 ### Step 3: Create test identities with the commands:

```
dfx identity new --disable-encryption Alice; dfx identity use Alice; export ALICE=$(dfx identity get-principal); 
dfx identity new --disable-encryption Bob; dfx identity use Bob; export BOB=$(dfx identity get-principal);
```

 ### Step 4: Deploy basic_dao with the initial test accounts:

```
dfx deploy --argument "(record {
 accounts = vec { record { owner = principal \"$ALICE\"; tokens = record { amount_e8s = 100_000_000:nat64 }; }; 
                  record { owner = principal \"$BOB\"; tokens = record { amount_e8s = 100_000_000:nat64 };}; };
 proposals = vec {};
 system_params = record {
     transfer_fee = record { amount_e8s = 10_000:nat64 };
     proposal_vote_threshold = record { amount_e8s = 10_000_000:nat64 };
     proposal_submission_deposit = record { amount_e8s = 10_000:nat64 };
 };
})"
```

 ### Step 5: List accounts and confirm you see the two test accounts:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao list_accounts '()'
```

Output:

```
(
  vec {
    record {
      owner = principal "5l3ql-7jlet-6yy5p-fk2ud-e7qul-6vqqx-cnqvu-zq75f-r76jx-tf6gb-2ae";
      tokens = record { amount_e8s = 100_000_000 : nat };
    };
    record {
      owner = principal "gbr7o-qdqaz-fm5ds-xrg4l-k7bwl-6m3vk-tvjas-ner6w-wt2hq-hiav7-3ae";
      tokens = record { amount_e8s = 100_000_000 : nat };
    };
  },
)
```

 ### Step 6: Call `account_balance` as Bob:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao account_balance '()'
```

You should see the output:

```
(record { amount_e8s = 100_000_000 : nat64 })
```

 ### Step 7: Transfer tokens to Alice:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao transfer "(record { to = principal \"$ALICE\"; amount = record { amount_e8s = 90_000_000:nat;};})";
```

Output:

`(variant { Ok })`

 ### Step 8: List accounts and see that the transfer was made:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao list_accounts '()'
```

Output:

```
 (
   vec {
     record {
       owner = principal "$ALICE";
       tokens = record { amount_e8s = 190_000_000 : nat64 };
     };
     record {
       owner = principal "$BOB";
       tokens = record { amount_e8s = 9_990_000 : nat64 };
     };
   },
 )
 ```

:::info
Note that the transfer fee was deducted from Bob's account.
:::

 ### Step 9: Let's make a proposal to change the transfer fee. We can call `get_system_params` to learn the current transfer fee:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao get_system_params '()';
```

Output:

```
(
  record {
    transfer_fee = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 : nat64 };
    proposal_vote_threshold = record { amount_e8s = 10_000_000 : nat64 };
    proposal_submission_deposit = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 : nat64 };
  },
)
```

To change `transfer_fee`, we need to submit a proposal by calling `submit_proposal`, which takes a `ProposalPayload` as an arg:

```
type ProposalPayload = record {
  canister_id: principal;
  method: text;
  message: blob;
};
```

We can change `transfer_fee` by calling `basic_dao`'s `update_system_params` method. This method takes a `UpdateSystemParamsPayload` as an arg, which we need to encode into a blob to use in `ProposalPayload`. Use didc to encode a `UpdateSystemParamsPayload`:

`didc encode '(record { transfer_fee = opt record { amount_e8s = 20_000:nat64; }; })' -f blob`

Output:

`blob "DIDL\03l\01\f2\c7\94\ae\03\01n\02l\01\b9\ef\93\80\08x\01\00\01 N\00\00\00\00\00\00"`

 ### Step 10: We can then submit the proposal:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao submit_proposal '(record { canister_id = principal "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai";
method = "update_system_params":text;
message = blob "DIDL\03l\01\f2\c7\94\ae\03\01n\02l\01\b9\ef\93\80\08x\01\00\01 N\00\00\00\00\00\00"; })'
```

Note the output proposal ID:

```
(variant { Ok = 0 : nat64 })
```

 ### Step 11: Confirm the proposal was created:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao get_proposal '(0:nat64)'
```

You should see `state = variant { Open };` in the output.

 ### Step 12: Vote on the proposal:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao vote '(record { proposal_id = 0:nat64; vote = variant { Yes };})'
```

You should see the following output:

```
(variant { Ok = variant { Open } })
```

Because we voted as Bob, and Bob does not have enough voting power to pass proposals, the proposal remains Open. To get the proposal accepted, we can vote with Alice:

```
dfx identity use Alice; dfx canister call basic_dao vote '(record { proposal_id = 0:nat64; vote = variant { Yes };})';
```

You should see the following output:

```
(variant { Ok = variant { Accepted } })
```

Query the proposal again:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao get_proposal '(0:nat64)'
```

And see that the state is `Succeeded`:

```
state = variant { Succeeded };
```

Query the system params again and see that transfer_fee has been updated:

```
dfx canister call basic_dao get_system_params '()'
```

Output:

```
(
  record {
    transfer_fee = record { amount_e8s = 20_000 : nat64 };
    proposal_vote_threshold = record { amount_e8s = 10_000_000 : nat64 };
    proposal_submission_deposit = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 : nat64 };
  },
)
```
