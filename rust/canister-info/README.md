# canister_info

The purpose of this dapp is to give developers a small (backend) dapp that uses the IC's `canister_info` management call to retrieve information about canisters including canister history.

You can find a detailed description of its methods in the form of doc comments in the source code.

Please also refer to the [Interface Specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-canister-info) for details about the `canister_info` management call.
