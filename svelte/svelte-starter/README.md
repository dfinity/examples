# Svelte template

This example is meant to give [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) developers an easy on-ramp to get started with developing decentralized applications (Dapps in short) for ICP. Dapps, also known as smart contracts, are specialized software that runs on a blockchain.

This template contains a Svelte app under `src/frontend` that can be hosted onchain on ICP.

You can see a deployed version of this template here: https://zgvi5-hiaaa-aaaam-aaasq-cai.ic0.app/

## Security considerations and best practices

If you base your application on this example, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [security best practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/security/overview) for developing on ICP. This example may not implement all the best practices.

For example, the following aspects are particularly relevant for creating frontends:
* [Use a well-audited authentication service and client-side IC libraries](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/web-app-development-security-best-practices#use-a-well-audited-authentication-service-and-client-side-ic-libraries).
* [Define security headers, including a Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/web-app-development-security-best-practices#define-security-headers-including-a-content-security-policy-csp).
* [Donâ€™t load JavaScript (and other assets) from untrusted domains](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/web-app-development-security-best-practices#dont-load-javascript-and-other-assets-from-untrusted-domains).
