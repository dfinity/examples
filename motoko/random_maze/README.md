# Random Maze

![Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/compatibility-0.7.0-blue)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/workflows/motoko-random_maze-example/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/actions?query=workflow%3Amotoko-random_maze-example)

The example generates a random maze using cryptographic randomness.

It illustrates:

* Importing library [Random](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/random) to use cryptographic randomness;
* Make asynchronous requests for entropy using
  shared function [Random.blob()](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/random#blob); and
* generating bounded, discrete random numbers using helper
  class [Random.Finite(entropy: blob)](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/random#type.Finite). Each instance, `f`, of this class consumes its initially supplied entropy as it is called to
  sample from various distributions. Calls to, for example `f.coin()` can fail by returning `null`, requiring `f` to be discarded in favour of a fresh instance of the `Finite` class, constructed from a fresh blob of entropy obtained from a new call to `Random.blob()` (for example `f := Finite(await Random.blob())`. 

## Introduction

The application is built from the following Motoko source code file:

*  [main.mo](./src/random_maze/main.mo), which contains the actor definition and methods exposed by this canister.

This actor use Motoko's `Random` library to generate a cryptographically
random maze of user-specified size.

Function `generate`, calls library function `Random.blob()` asynchronously to
obtain 256-bits of raw entropy (256 random bits as 32 bytes) from the Internet Computer. It makes these calls on demand as it is constructing a maze.
The bits of these blobs are consumed to generate
samples from a variety of discrete distributions using some of
the other classes and functions of library `Random.mo`.

## Security Considerations and Security Best Practices

If you base your application on this example, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [Security Best Practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. This example may not implement all the best practices.

For example, the following aspects are particularly relevant for this app, since it employs cryptographic algorithms:
* [Donâ€™t implement crypto yourself](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/general-security-best-practices#dont-implement-crypto-yourself)
* [Use secure cryptographic schemes](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/general-security-best-practices#use-secure-cryptographic-schemes)

## Prerequisites

Verify the following before running this demo:

*  You have downloaded and installed the [DFINITY Canister
   SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org).

*  You have stopped any Internet Computer or other network process that would
   create a port conflict on 8000.

## Demo

1. Start a local internet computer.

   ```text
   dfx start
   ```

1. Open a new terminal window.

2. Install the front-end dependencies:

   ```text
   npm install
   ```

3. Build and deploy your canisters.

   ```text
   dfx deploy
   ```

4. Take note of the URL at which the user interface is accessible.

   ```text
   echo "http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=$(dfx canister id random_maze_assets)"
   ```

5. Alternatively, generate two random mazes of sizes 9x9 and 65x65:

   ```text
   dfx canister call random_maze generate '(9)'
   dfx canister call random_maze generate '(65)'
   ```
