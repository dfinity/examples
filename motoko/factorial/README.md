This example demonstrates a recursive mathematical function that calculates the
product of all positive integers less than or equal to its input.

## Prerequisites

Verify the following before running this demo:

*  You have downloaded and installed the [DFINITY Canister
   SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org).

*  You have stopped any Internet Computer or other network process that would
   create a port conflict on 8000.

## Security Considerations and Security Best Practices

If you base your application on this example, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [Security Best Practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. This example may not implement all the best practices.

## Demo

1. Start a local internet computer.

   ```text
   dfx start
   ```

1. Open a new terminal window.

1. Reserve an identifier for your canister.

   ```text
   dfx canister create factorial
   ```

1. Build your canister.

   ```text
   dfx build
   ```

1. Deploy your canister.

   ```text
   dfx canister install factorial
   ```

1. Calculate the factorial of 20.

   ```text
   dfx canister call factorial fac '(20)'
   ```

1. Observe the following result.

   ```text
   (2_432_902_008_176_640_000)
   ```
