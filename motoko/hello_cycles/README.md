# Hello cycles
![Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/compatibility-0.6.25-blue)

The `hello_cycles` sample project provides a simple example to illustrate how you might add functions to receive cycles, transfer cycles, and check your cycle balance with a simple Motoko actor (canister).

This sample project assumes that you are using the default cycles wallet canister that is created for you.

This example consists of the following functions (see [src/hello_cycles/main.mo](./src/hello_cycles/main.mo)):

* The `wallet_balance : () -> async Nat` function enables you to check the current cycle balance for the canister.
* The `wallet_receive : () -> { amount : Nat64 }` function enables the program to accept cycles that are sent to the canister from a wallet.
  Both the name and type of this function are
  dictated by the wallet's implementation (so don't mess with them).

* The `transfer : (shared () -> (), Nat) -> async { refunded : Nat }` function enables the program to transfer cycles to any
  shared function with candid signature "() -> ()" (assuming it accepts cycles).
  One example is the wallet's own `wallet_receive : () -> ()` function.

  (_Beware_: the wallet's `wallet_receive` return type differs from `hello_cycle`'s `wallet_receive`.)

## Security Considerations and Security Best Practices

If you base your application on this example, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [Security Best Practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. This example may not implement all the best practices.

For example, the following aspect is particularly relevant for this app:
* [Protect against draining the cycles balance](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/rust-canister-development-security-best-practices#protect-against-draining-the-cycles-balance), since this canister consumes cycles that are being transferred to other canisters. 

## Prerequisites

Verify the following before running this demo:

*  You have downloaded and installed the [DFINITY Canister
   SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org).

*  You have stopped any Internet Computer or other network process that would
   create a port conflict on 8000.

## Demo

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Start the Internet Computer locally by running the following command:

   ```text
   dfx start --clean --background
   ```

3. Deploy the project locally by running the following command:

   ```text
   dfx deploy
   ```

4. Check that the current cycles balance of canister `hello_cycles` by running the following command:

   ```text
   dfx canister call hello_cycles wallet_balance
   ```

   You can also see the cycles balance of `hello_cyles` (or any canister you control) by calling:

   ```text
   dfx canister status hello_cycles
   ```

5. Run:

   ```text
   dfx identity get-wallet
   dfx canister id hello_cycles
   ```
   to display the `default` wallet and `hello_cycles` canister principals.


   Below, we'll frequently use `$(dfx identity get-wallet)`  and `$(dfx canister id hello_cycles)` to splice canister principals into longer bash commands.

6. Attempt to send 2 trillion cycles from the default wallet to the `hello_cycles` canister by running the following command:

   ```text
   dfx canister call $(dfx identity get-wallet) wallet_send "(record { canister = principal \"$(dfx canister id hello_cycles)\"; amount = (2000000000000:nat64); } )"
   ```

   The wallet's `wallet_send` function transfers the amount to the argument canister's `wallet_receive` function (see above), and returns a result signalling success or failure.

7. Verify that the cycles balance for the `hello_cycles` canister has increased by `10_000_000` by running the following command:

   ```text
   dfx canister call hello_cycles wallet_balance
   ```

   The amount is only increased by `10_000_000` because the implementation of `wallet_receive` is coded to accept _at
   most_ 10_000_000 cycles, even when more cycles where transferred with the call.
   The unaccepted cycles are not lost, but implicitly refunded to the caller (in this case, the wallet).

8. Send some cycles from the `hello_cycles` canister back to the wallet
   by running the command:

   ```text
   dfx canister call hello_cycles transfer "(func \"$(dfx identity get-wallet)\".\"wallet_receive\", 5000000)"
   ```

9. Verify that the cycles balance of `hello_cycles` canister has decreased with:

   ```text
   dfx canister call hello_cycles wallet_balance
   ```

In step 8, we are passing our own wallet's `wallet_receive` function as the first argument, followed by the amount.
We, or a third party, could also pass any another function of the same signature, belonging to any other canister or wallet.

WARNING: without some additional access control checks (omitted here), a malicious client could abuse our naive
transfer function to drain the canister of all of its cycles.
