# Calc

The program uses the `+cell+` variable to contain an integer number that represents the current result of a calculator operation. 

This program supports the following types of function calls:

* The `+add+` function call accepts input and performs addition.
* The `+sub+` function call accepts input and performs subtraction.
* The `+mul+` function call accepts input and performs multiplication.
* The `+div+` function call accepts input and performs division.
* The `+clearall+` function clears the `+cell+` value stored as the result of previous operations, resetting the `+cell+` value to zero.

The `+div+` function also includes code to prevent the program from attempting to divide by zero.
