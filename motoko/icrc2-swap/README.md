# ICRC-2 Swap

ICRC-2 Swap is simple canister demonstrating how to safely work with ICRC-2
tokens. It handles depositing, swapping, and withdrawing ICRC-2 tokens.

The asynchronous nature of developing on the Internet Computer presents some
unique challenges, which mean the design patterns for inter-canister calls are
different from other synchronous blockchains.

## Features

- **Deposit Tokens**: Users can deposit tokens into the contract to be ready for
  swapping.
- **Swap Tokens**: Users can swap the tokens for each other. This is implemented
  in a very simple naive 1:1 manner. The point is just to demonstrate some
  minimal behavior.
- **Withdraw Tokens**: Users can withdraw the resulting tokens after
  swapping.

# Local deployment

## Prerequisites

- [x] Install the [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx).
- [x] Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Step 1: Start a local instance of the Internet Computer

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
```

## Step 2: Create our user accounts

```bash
export OWNER=$(dfx identity get-principal)

dfx identity new alice
export ALICE=$(dfx identity get-principal --identity alice)

dfx identity new bob
export BOB=$(dfx identity get-principal --identity bob)
```

## Step 2: Deploy two tokens

Deploy Token A:

```bash
dfx deploy token_a --argument '
  (variant {
    Init = record {
      token_name = "Token A";
      token_symbol = "A";
      minting_account = record {
        owner = principal "'${OWNER}'";
      };
      initial_balances = vec {
        record {
          record {
            owner = principal "'${ALICE}'";
          };
          100_000_000_000;
        };
      };
      metadata = vec {};
      transfer_fee = 10_000;
      archive_options = record {
        trigger_threshold = 2000;
        num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
        controller_id = principal "'${OWNER}'";
      };
      feature_flags = opt record {
        icrc2 = true;
      };
    }
  })
'
```

Deploy Token B:

```bash
dfx deploy token_b --argument '
  (variant {
    Init = record {
      token_name = "Token B";
      token_symbol = "B";
      minting_account = record {
        owner = principal "'${OWNER}'";
      };
      initial_balances = vec {
        record {
          record {
            owner = principal "'${BOB}'";
          };
          100_000_000_000;
        };
      };
      metadata = vec {};
      transfer_fee = 10_000;
      archive_options = record {
        trigger_threshold = 2000;
        num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
        controller_id = principal "'${OWNER}'";
      };
      feature_flags = opt record {
        icrc2 = true;
      };
    }
  })
'
```

## Step 3: Deploy the swap canister

The swap canister accepts deposits, and performs the swap.

```bash
export TOKEN_A=$(dfx canister id token_a)
export TOKEN_B=$(dfx canister id token_b)

dfx deploy swap --argument '
  record {
    token_a = (principal "'${TOKEN_A}'");
    token_b = (principal "'${TOKEN_B}'");
  }
'

export SWAP=$(dfx canister id swap)
```

## Step 4: Approve & deposit tokens

Before we can swap the tokens, they must be transferred to the swap canister.
With ICRC-2, this is a two-step process. First we approve the transfer:

```bash
# Approve Bob to deposit 1.00000000 of Token B, and 0.0001 extra for the
# transfer fee
dfx canister call --identity alice token_a icrc2_approve '
  record {
    amount = 100_010_000;
    spender = record {
      owner = principal "'${SWAP}'";
    };
  }
'

# Approve Bob to deposit 1.00000000 of Token B, and 0.0001 extra for the
# transfer fee
dfx canister call --identity bob token_b icrc2_approve '
  record {
    amount = 100_010_000;
    spender = record {
      owner = principal "'${SWAP}'";
    };
  }
'
```

Then we can call the `swap` canister's `deposit` method. This method will do the
actual ICRC-1 token transfer, to move the tokens from our wallet into the `swap`
canister, and then update our deposited token balance in the `swap` canister.

Side Note: The amounts we use here are denoted in "e8s". Since out token has 8
decimal places, we writeout all 8 decimal places. So 1.00000000 becomes
100,000,000.

```bash
# Deposit Alice's tokens
dfx canister call --identity alice swap deposit 'record {
  token = principal "'${TOKEN_A}'";
  from = record {
    owner = principal "'${ALICE}'";
  };
  amount = 100_000_000;
}'

# Deposit Bob's tokens
dfx canister call --identity bob swap deposit 'record {
  token = principal "'${TOKEN_B}'";
  from = record {
    owner = principal "'${BOB}'";
  };
  amount = 100_000_000;
}'
```

## Step 5: Perform a swap

```bash
dfx canister call swap swap 'record {
  user_a = principal "'${ALICE}'";
  user_b = principal "'${BOB}'";
}'
```

We can check the deposited balances with:

```bash
dfx canister call swap balances
```

That should show us that now Bob holds Token A, and Alice holds Token B in
the swap contract.

## Step 6: Withdraw tokens

After the swap, our balandes in the swap canister will have been updated, and we
can withdraw our newly received tokens into our wallet.

```bash
# Withdraw Alice's Token B balance (1.00000000), minus the 0.0001 transfer fee
dfx canister call --identity alice swap withdraw 'record {
  token = principal "'${TOKEN_B}'";
  to = record {
    owner = principal "'${ALICE}'";
  };
  amount = 99_990_000;
}'
```

```bash
# Withdraw Bob's Token A balance (1.00000000), minus the 0.0001 transfer fee
dfx canister call --identity bob swap withdraw 'record {
  token = principal "'${TOKEN_A}'";
  to = record {
    owner = principal "'${BOB}'";
  };
  amount = 99_990_000;
}'
```

## Step 7: Check token balances

```bash
# Check Alice's Token A balance. They should now have 998.99980000 A
dfx canister call token_a icrc1_balance_of 'record {
  owner = principal "'${ALICE}'";
}'

# Check Bob's Token A balance, They should now have 0.99990000 A.
dfx canister call token_a icrc1_balance_of 'record {
  owner = principal "'${ALICE}'";
}'
```

If everything is working, you should see a your dfx wallet balances reflected in
the token balances.

# Running the test suite

The example comes with a test suite to demonstrate the basic functionality. It
shows how to use this repo from a Javascript client.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Install the [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx).
- [x] Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Step 1: Start a local instance of the Internet Computer

```bash
dfx start --clean --background
```

## Step 2: Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Run the test suite

```bash
make test
```

# Possible Improvements

- Keep a history of deposits/withdrawaps/swaps.
- Add a frontend.

# Known issues

- Any DeFi on the Internet Computer is experimental. It is a constantly evolving
  space, with unknown attacks, and should be treated as such.
- Due to the nature of asynchronous inter-canister messaging on the IC, it is possible for
  malicious token canisters to cause this swap contract to deadlock. It should
  only be used with trusted token canisters.
- Currently, there are no limits on the state size of this canister. This could
  allow malicious users to spam the canister, bloating the size until it runs
  out of space. However, the only way to increase the size is to call `deposit`,
  which would cost tokens. For a real canister, you should calculate the maximum
  size of your canister, limit it to a reasonable amount, and monitor the
  current size to know when to re-architect.
