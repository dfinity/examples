# Flying Ninja

Flying Ninja is a 2D side-scroller game where players interact with the flying ninja character using their keyboard's space bar to move up and down. The goal is to avoid the obstacles and obtain points for each obstacle you dodge. When the game ends, the user can add their score to the leaderboard.

The game's logic is written in [Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction), a programming language designed specifically for developing canisters on ICP.

## Project structure

The `/backend` folder contains the Motoko canister, `app.mo`. The `/frontend` folder contains web assets for the application's user interface. The user interface is written using the React framework. Edit the `mops.toml` file to add [Motoko dependencies](https://mops.one/) to the project.
