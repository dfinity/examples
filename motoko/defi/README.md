# Defi Example

This repo contains a simple defi exchange that demonstrates the interaction with ICP and tokens on the IC. For a more detailed explanation check out the [architecture.md](architecture.md) file or visit the official [documentation](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/examples/defi.html)

This example can be seen running, here:
- frontend: https://gzz56-daaaa-aaaal-qai2a-cai.ic0.app/
- AkitaDIP20: `gl7kh-pqaaa-aaaal-qaiza-cai`
- GoldenDIP20: `gm6mt-ciaaa-aaaal-qaizq-cai`

## Dependencies

- [dfx](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove.html)
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If you want to deploy the rust version, make sure you add wasm as a target:

```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
## Quickstart

This deploys a local ledger, two DIP20 Tokens, II, and our project.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules https://github.com/dfinity/examples.git
# for the rust imeplementation examples/rust/defi
cd examples/motoko/defi
make install
```

The install scripts output the URL to visit the exchange frontend, or you can regenerate the URL `"http://localhost:8000?canisterId=$(dfx canister id frontend)"`. To interact with the exchange, you can create a local internet identity by clicking the login button. 

You can give yourself some tokens and ICP by running an initialization script with your II Principal that you can copy from the frontend. After adding balanced reload the frontend.

```bash
make init-local II_PRINCIPAL=<YOUR II PRINCIPAL>
```

To trade with yourself, you can open a second incognito browser window. 

## Development

Reinstall backend canister

```bash
dfx deploy defi_dapp -m reinstall --argument '(null)'
```

Local frontend development

```bash
make frontend
```

## Test

Run from home directory

```bash
make test
```


## Examples

### Demo

See [demo.sh](test/demo.sh).

### Trade

See [trade.sh](test/trade.sh).

### Token transfers

See [transfer.sh](test/transfer.sh).

### Deploy DIP20 token

See [deploy_dip20.sh](scripts/deploy_dip20.sh).

## Roadmap
- Improve Plug wallet support
- Make exchange more predictable

## Troubleshooting

### DFX deploys canisters with the same ID

Clear `.dfx` directories

```
make clean
```

### Deposit address not loading 

Make sure you are logged out with II and refresh the page.

### Address already in use

This is probably due to an orphan `dfx` instance. Find the PID of the orphan dfx instance

```
ps -xa | grep dfx
kill <dfx PID>
```

### Missing cmake

Need to install cmake in your environment

MacOS: `brew install cmake`
Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install cmake`

### Compiling takes ages

Check for a cycle in the dependencies.

### Incorrect result from `bundle.js`

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/examples.git
cd examples
git checkout defi-example
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd motoko/defi
make install
```
