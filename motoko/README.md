# Motoko examples

## Standalone Motoko

These examples show the Motoko language as a backend language for the IC, operating directly with clients, without a front end component.

### Basic

- [`counter`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/counter) -- basic (stable) variable demo.
- [`hello_cycles`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/hello_cycles) -- basic cycles demo.
- [`who_am_i`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/who_am_i) -- basic caller identification demo.

### Intermediate

- [`classes`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/classes) -- dynamic actor (class) instantiation.
- [`pub-sub`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/pub-sub) -- multiple canisters, with publisher-subscriber inter-canister calls.
- [`icrc2-swap`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/icrc2-swap) -- deposit, swap, and withdraw two ICRC-2 tokens.

## Minimal front end.

These examples use a minimal front end component.

- [`random_maze`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/random_maze) -- random maze generation, with IC-based randomness.
- [`cert_var`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/cert-var) -- simple certified variable (a single 32-bit number), with client-side certificate validation.
- [`minimal-counter-dapp`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/minimal-counter-dapp) -- counter dapp with minimal front end.


## Full stack.

These examples use a "conventional" front end component (via `React.Component`).

- [`life`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/life) -- demonstrates upgrades among three versions and stable state migration.
- [`superheroes`](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/superheroes) -- CRUD-like demo service.

## Security Considerations and Security Best Practices

If you base your application on one of these examples, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [Security Best Practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. The examples provided here may not implement all the best practices.
