# Token transfer_from

[View this samples code on GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer_from).

## Overview

`token_transfer_from_backend` is a canister that can transfer ICRC-1 tokens on behalf of accounts to other accounts. It is an example of a canister that uses an ICRC-1 ledger canister that supports the [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-2) approve and transfer from standard. Sample code is available in [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer_from) and [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer_from).

## Architecture

The sample code revolves around one core transfer function which takes as input the amount of tokens to transfer, the `Account` to which to transfer tokens and returns either success or an error in case e.g. the token transfer canister doesnâ€™t have enough tokens to do the transfer or the caller has not approved the canister to spend their tokens. In case of success, a unique identifier of the transaction is returned. The example code assumes the caller of `transfer` has already approved the token transfer canister to spend their tokens.

This sample will use the Rust variant.

## Prerequisites

This example requires an installation of:

-   [x] Install the [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx).
-   [x] Download and install [git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## How to get there

The following steps will guide you through the process of setting up the token transfer canister for your own project.

:::info 

If you just want to interact with this example, follow steps 4-6 and 8-10 below.

:::

### Step 1: Create a new `dfx` project and navigate into the project's directory.

```bash
dfx new --type=motoko token_transfer_from --no-frontend
cd token_transfer_from
```

### Step 2: Determine ICRC-1 ledger file locations

:::info 

You can read more about how to setup the ICRC-1 ledger locally [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/icrc-1/icrc1-ledger-setup).

:::

Go to the [releases overview](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/releases) and copy the latest replica binary revision. At the time of writing, this is `d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929`.

The URL for the ledger Wasm module is `https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/<REVISION>/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz`, so with the above revision it would be `https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz`.

The URL for the ledger .did file is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/<REVISION>/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did`, so with the above revision it would be `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did`.

**OPTIONAL:**
If you want to make sure, you have the latest ICRC-1 ledger files you can run the following script.

```sh
curl -o download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/326df23607fc8280a047daba2d8462f1dfc57466/rs/rosetta-api/scripts/download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh"
chmod +x download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh
./download_latest_icrc1_ledger.sh
```

### Step 3: Configure the `dfx.json` file to use the ledger :

Replace its contents with this but adapt the URLs to be the ones you determined in step 2. Note that we are deploying the ICRC-1 ledger to the same canister id the ckBTC ledger uses on mainnet. This will make it easier to interact with it later.

:::info 

Don't forget to add the `icrc1_ledger_canister` as a dependency for `token_transfer_from_backend`, otherwise the build will fail.

:::

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "token_transfer_from_backend": {
            "main": "src/token_transfer_from_backend/main.mo",
            "type": "motoko",
            "dependencies": ["icrc1_ledger_canister"]
        },
        "icrc1_ledger_canister": {
            "type": "custom",
            "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did",
            "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz",
            "specified_id": "mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai"
        }
    },
    "defaults": {
        "build": {
            "args": "",
            "packtool": ""
        }
    },
    "output_env_file": ".env",
    "version": 1
}
```

If you chose to download the ICRC-1 ledger files with the script, you need to replace the Candid and Wasm file entries:

```
...
"candid": icrc1_ledger.did,
"wasm" : icrc1_ledger.wasm.gz,
...
```

### Step 4: Start a local replica:

```bash
dfx start --background --clean
```

### Step 5: Deploy the ICRC-1 ledger locally:

:::info 

Transfers from the `minting_account` will create Mint transactions. Transfers to the minting account will create Burn transactions.

:::

Take a moment to read the details of the call made below. Not only are you deploying an ICRC-1 ledger canister, you are also:

-   Setting the minting account to the anonymous principal (`2vxsx-fae`)
-   Minting 100 tokens to the default identity
-   Setting the transfer fee to 0.0001 tokens
-   Naming the token Local ICRC1 / L-ICRC1
-   Enabling the ICRC-2 standard for the ledger

```bash
dfx deploy icrc1_ledger_canister --argument "(variant {
  Init = record {
    token_symbol = \"ICRC1\";
    token_name = \"L-ICRC1\";
    minting_account = record {
      owner = principal \"$(dfx identity --identity anonymous get-principal)\"
    };
    transfer_fee = 10_000;
    metadata = vec {};
    initial_balances = vec {
      record {
        record {
          owner = principal \"$(dfx identity --identity default get-principal)\";
        };
        10_000_000_000;
      };
    };
    archive_options = record {
      num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
      trigger_threshold = 2000;
      controller_id = principal \"$(dfx identity --identity anonymous get-principal)\";
    };
    feature_flags = opt record {
      icrc2 = true;
    };
  }
})"
```

If successful, the output should be:

```bash
Deployed canisters.
URLs:
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    icrc1_ledger_canister: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai&id=mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai
```

### Step 6: Verify that the ledger canister is healthy and working as expected by using the command:

:::info 

[Learn more about how to interact with the ICRC-1 ledger](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/icrc-1/using-icrc1-ledger#icrc-1-and-icrc-1-extension-endpoints).

:::

````bash
dfx canister call icrc1_ledger_canister icrc1_balance_of "(record {
  owner = principal \"$(dfx identity --identity default get-principal)\";
})"
```

The output should be:

```bash
(10_000_000_000 : nat)
````

### Step 7: Prepare the token transfer canister:

Replace the contents of the `src/token_transfer_from_backend/main.mo` file with the following:

```motoko
import Icrc1Ledger "canister:icrc1_ledger_canister";
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
import Result "mo:base/Result";
import Error "mo:base/Error";

actor {

  type TransferArgs = {
    amount : Nat;
    toAccount : Icrc1Ledger.Account;
  };

  public shared ({ caller }) func transfer(args : TransferArgs) : async Result.Result<Icrc1Ledger.BlockIndex, Text> {
    Debug.print(
      "Transferring "
      # debug_show (args.amount)
      # " tokens to account"
      # debug_show (args.toAccount)
    );

    let transferFromArgs : Icrc1Ledger.TransferFromArgs = {
      // the account we want to transfer tokens from (in this case we assume the caller approved the canister to spend funds on their behalf)
      from = {
        owner = caller;
        subaccount = null;
      };
      // can be used to distinguish between transactions
      memo = null;
      // the amount we want to transfer
      amount = args.amount;
      // the subaccount we want to spend the tokens from (in this case we assume the default subaccount has been approved)
      spender_subaccount = null;
      // if not specified, the default fee for the canister is used
      fee = null;
      // we take the principal and subaccount from the arguments and convert them into an account identifier
      to = args.toAccount;
      // a timestamp indicating when the transaction was created by the caller; if it is not specified by the caller then this is set to the current ICP time
      created_at_time = null;
    };

    try {
      // initiate the transfer
      let transferFromResult = await Icrc1Ledger.icrc2_transfer_from(transferFromArgs);

      // check if the transfer was successfull
      switch (transferFromResult) {
        case (#Err(transferError)) {
          return #err("Couldn't transfer funds:\n" # debug_show (transferError));
        };
        case (#Ok(blockIndex)) { return #ok blockIndex };
      };
    } catch (error : Error) {
      // catch any errors that might occur during the transfer
      return #err("Reject message: " # Error.message(error));
    };
  };
};

```

### Step 8: Deploy the token transfer canister:

```bash
dfx deploy token_transfer_from_backend
```

### Step 9: Approve the canister to transfer funds on behalf of the user:

:::info 

Make sure that you are using the default `dfx` account that we minted tokens to in step 5 for the following steps.

:::

Make the following call to approve the `token_transfer_from_backend` canister to transfer 100 tokens on behalf of the `default` identity:

```bash
dfx canister call --identity default icrc1_ledger_canister icrc2_approve "(
  record {
    spender= record {
      owner = principal \"$(dfx canister id token_transfer_from_backend)\";
    };
    amount = 10_000_000_000: nat;
  }
)"
```

If successful, the output should be:

```bash
(variant { Ok = 1 : nat })
```

### Step 10: Let the canister transfer funds on behalf of the user:

Now that the canister has an approval for the `default` identities tokens on the ledger, the canister can transfer 1 token on behalf of the `default` identity to another account, in this case to the canisters own account.

```bash
dfx canister call token_transfer_from_backend transfer "(record {
  amount = 100_000_000;
  toAccount = record {
    owner = principal \"$(dfx canister id token_transfer_from_backend)\";
  };
})"
```

## Security considerations and best practices

If you base your application on this example, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [security best practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. This example may not implement all the best practices.

For example, the following aspects are particularly relevant for this app:

-   [Inter-canister calls and rollbacks](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/security/security-best-practices/overview), since issues around inter-canister calls (here the ledger) can e.g. lead to time-of-check time-of-use or double spending security bugs.
-   [Certify query responses if they are relevant for security](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/general-security-best-practices#certify-query-responses-if-they-are-relevant-for-security), since this is essential when e.g. displaying important financial data in the frontend that may be used by users to decide on future transactions.
-   [Use a decentralized governance system like SNS to make a canister have a decentralized controller](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/security/security-best-practices/overview), since decentralizing control is a fundamental aspect of decentralized finance applications.
