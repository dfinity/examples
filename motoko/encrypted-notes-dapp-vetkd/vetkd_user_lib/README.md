# Content of this directory
The two files in this directory were generated by running
```
wasm-pack build --target web --release
```
in the package root of a clone of the git repository containing the vetKD user library (https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/packages/ic-vetkd-utils). Note that `wasm-pack` outputs the
files into a `pkg/` folder.

See also https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/wasm#using-with-wasm-bindgen-and-wasm-pack.

## Notes
Ideally we would simply use the vetKD user library via an npm package (which .tgz can easily be created by first running `wasm-pack build --target bundler --release` and then running `wasm-pack pack`; see also https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/reference/deployment.html#bundlers), but unfortunately the _rollup_ bundler doesn't seem to support this kind of package yet (only the webpack bundler seems to work currently) because with the entry
```
"ic-vetkd": "file:vetkd_user_lib/ic-vetkd-0.1.0.tgz",
```
in the `dependencies` section in `package.json`, we run into the following runtime error
```
TypeError: wasm.__wbindgen_add_to_stack_pointer is not a function
```
Maybe in the future _rollup_ will support npm packages, but as of now this doesn't seem to be the case.
