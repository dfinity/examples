# Simple to-do

## Overview
This example illustrates how to create a simple to-do checklist application. 

The application is built from the following Motoko source code files:

- `Utils.mo`: contains the core functions for adding, completing, and removing to-do checklist items.
- `Types.mo`: contains the type definition of a to-do checklist item.
- `Main.mo`: contains the actor definition and methods exposed by this canister.

This is a Motoko example that does not currently have a Rust variant. 

## Prerequisites
This example requires an installation of:

- [x] Install the [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx).

Begin by opening a terminal window.

### Step 1: Navigate into the folder containing the project's files and start a local instance of the replica with the command:

```bash
cd examples/motoko/simple-to-do
dfx start --background
```

### Step 2: Deploy the canister:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

### Step 3: Create a to-do checklist by invoking the addTodo method:

```bash
dfx canister call simple_to_do addTodo '("Create a project")'
dfx canister call simple_to_do addTodo '("Build the project")'
dfx canister call simple_to_do addTodo '("Deploy the project")'
```

### Step 4: Display the to-do checklist by invoking the showTodos method:

```bash
dfx canister call simple_to_do showTodos
```

### Step 5: Verify the output returns the values you inputted:

```bash
("
___TO-DOs___
(1) Create a project
(2) Build the project
(3) Deploy the project")
```

### Step 6: Complete a to-do checklist item by invoking the completeTodo method:

```bash
dfx canister call simple_to_do completeTodo '(1)'
```

### Step 7: Display the to-do checklist by invoking the showTodos method.

```bash
dfx canister call simple_to_do showTodos
```

### Step 8: Verify the return value matches what you would expect.

```bash
("
___TO-DOs___
(1) Create a project âœ”
(2) Build the project
(3) Deploy the project")
```
## Security considerations and best practices

If you base your application on this example, we recommend you familiarize yourself with and adhere to the [security best practices](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/) for developing on the Internet Computer. This example may not implement all the best practices.

For example, the following aspect is particularly relevant for this app:
* [Validate inputs](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/security/rust-canister-development-security-best-practices#validate-inputs), since this canister processes user-provided input.
