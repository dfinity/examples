# PubSub

This sample project demonstrates how functions may be passed as arguments of inter-canister calls to be used as callbacks.

A common problem in both distributed and decentralized systems is keeping separate services (or canisters) synchronized with one another. While there are many potential solutions to this problem, a popular one is the publisher/subscriber pattern or "PubSub". PubSub is an especially valuable pattern on the Internet Computer as its primary drawback, message delivery failures, does not apply.
