# hello-angular-motoko
This is an example of a Motoko project with an Angular 14 frontend.

<a name="prerequesites"></a> 
## Prerequesites
- [Install DFX](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/local-quickstart).
- [Install Angular Globally](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
- Install npm packages from the project root:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
- For live IC deployment: A wallet set up as described in the [quickstart guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/hello10mins/).
    

-----
## Getting Started

- Initalize the project declarations and dfx processes:
    ```Bash
    # Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
    npm run init:dfx
    ```
- Serve the project locally:

    ```bash
    # Starts the replica, running in the background
    # Serves Angular and dfx canisters locally with hot reloading
    npm run start
    ```
Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

If you make any changes while in development mode, the project will recompile on both the Angular and Motoko side.

-----

## Deploying the Project to the IC:
- From the project root, deploy the project to your canisters provided in the [Prerequesites](#prerequesites).

    ```bash
    npm run deploy:dfx
    ```

-----

## Testing Locally:
- From the project root.

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```


-----
## Considerations
- The npm `build`, `prebuild` and `prestart` commands are used by the IC processes. Using them elsewhere may have unintended side effects with other build processes.
- Currently, the Typescript generated by DFX has trailing commas, which produces a conflict with Angular's default build configurations. Fixing this is beyound the scope of this example.
- This example is intended to help those already familar with Angular to get started with the IC. This example is designed to be as straight forward as possible but it is not intended as a tool for learning Angular.

### Additional CLI Commands

|         `npm run`       |Description                         
|----------------|-------------------------------
|`init:dfx`| Initial bootstrap of the IC.   
|`start`| Serve both project IC canisters locally with hot reloading.         
|`deploy:dfx`         |Deploy to IC           
|`restart:dfx`         |Restarts the local canister execution environment and web server processes. You can use this to Start the IC services as well.
|`restart:clean:dfx`|Starts the local canister execution environment and web server processes in a clean state by removing checkpoints from your project cache. You can use this to set your project cache to a new state when troubleshooting or debugging.|
|`generate:motoko`| Generate canister type declarations for motoko supported programming languages. This will generate the `src/declarations` folder and remove conflicts. These generated js files allow you to consume the motoko language service on the front end. i.e `const  ic_service = require('src/declarations/motoko').motoko;`
