# Daily planner

Daily planner features a monthly calender that can be used to track daily activities, appointments, or tasks. Data for each task is stored onchain. For each day, a historic fact can be queried using HTTPS outcalls, which is a feature that allows ICP canisters to obtain data from external sources.

This application's logic is written in [Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction), a programming language designed specifically for developing canisters on ICP.
