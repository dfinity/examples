## Tips for contributing to example apps

Depending on the type of contribution you want to make, you might follow a different workflow.
For example, if you are only interested in reporting an issue, there's no need to clone repository or set up a documentation environment.

This section describes the most common workflow scenarios:

- Reporting an issue
- Submitting your own example

### Reporting an issue

To open a new issue:

1. Click **Issues**.

1. Click **New Issue**.

1. Click **Open a blank issue**.

1. Type a title and description, then click **Submit new issue**.

    Be as clear and descriptive as possible.

    For any problem, describe it in detail, including details about the example app, the version of the code you are using, the results you expected, and how the actual results differed from your expectations.

### Submitting your own example

We're not accepting community examples at this time -- we have something better planned.
